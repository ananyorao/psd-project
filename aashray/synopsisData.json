Proper code reviews are absolutely necessary before the code is checked in. These reviews should also need to happen from a number of people instead of a single person as it will help bring out the fault in the code for sure. Checking the code for errors is of utmost importance in any kind of software development scenario and it becomes even more important if multiple people are working on the same project and changes made by one person may affect the ones made by others.

PNB Housing Finance Limited has used some of the measures mentioned and has performed quite well. The market for housing finance is quite vast in India, given the very low level mortgage penetration. Use of advanced technology, modern credit scoring models and sophisticated data mining tools and precise underwriting methodology can significantly improve management of credit risk, and hence improve profitability and operational efficiency. Making use of RMBS mode of financing and cheap external sources for long term financing are other meaningful strategies. Above all, the inherent strengths of HFCs (viz. much more specialized services as compared to services of a general nature of CBs) should be taken advantage of by them. The yet untouched portion of Indian population by financing agencies corresponds to the unlimited opportunities. The continuous innovation is the key for the sustainable growth of HFCs in India. Domain knowledge acquired: 1.Ratio Analysis of the financial statements mentioned in the Annual Reports, Balance Sheet analysis 2.Understanding of Housing Finance Sector in the country and its past 3.Attended a number of Seminars and Conferences on Policy Research by the eminent Economists in the country and abroad Most of the project was done using the following software: Excel and SAS, Prowess Database.

The existing housing finance institutions though have done pioneering job in the nation building but in recent years it has been felt that they have not been able to shoulder that social responsibility, to a desirable extent. From very low exposure to the housing sector initially, banks have gone very fast in extending credit to this sector which has witnessed unprecedented expansion. The existence of HFCs is under threat because of the suffocating competition and their structural disadvantages as compared to SCBs. Because of such a difficult situation, the HFCs are aggressive about their future competitive strategies and most of them are ready to finance such research work.

The term “Custody” itself means “the protective care or guardianship of something” and this is exactly what JP Morgan does, by keeping the accounts of its clients safe and secure. The term “Reconciliation” means “the action of making financial accounts consistent”. This ensures that whichever stocks or bonds the client invests in, his personal accounts of those securities are in line with the accounts of the different fund managers who issue these securities. If these accounts are in line, the payment is received by the client on the date of payment. Sometimes these accounts are not in line, which leads to the client not receiving the payment on the payment date. So, in order to avoid this, pre -reconciliation is performed on the day before the payment date. This leads to matching of the two accounts a day before payment is actually made, which removes all hassles regarding payment the next day","projectContribution":"  This project was started in early 2015, and has led to many mismatches and conflicts being resolved over the year, making it one of JP Morgan’s most successful projects in recent times.

It takes cue from Toyota Production System, a system that lead Toyota to become a major automobile manufacturer in the world. Taking inspiration from the latter it is an attempt to bring quality of manufacturing in all plants at par with each other and improve it. The first part of my project was on implementation of TMPS guidelines on Process Sheet, PFMEA and PFD. PFMEA is an essential document in manufacturing industry and helps operators and managers to identify risk associated with processes of manufacturing and failure of meeting standards on customers. PFD lists processes in order and Process Sheet details them in regards to implementation and requirement. I was involved in making PFD, PFMEA and Process Sheet of GOEM engine and migrated all PFMEA of Engine section as a part of my first project. As a second part of my project I used PLM software to make Estimate sheet for Engine Part No. 252501610174, BS III Engine","natureOfWork":" The work that I have done i.e. mainly compiling of documents like Process Flow Diagram, Potential Failure Mode and Effect Analysis and Process Sheet for engines can be identified as New Product Development, Testing and improvement in productivity of the product.","summary":" The work done by me as follows – 1.

Making process sheet for SPK-SPE engine (Dressing Line) It had helped me to learn the application of documents such as Process Sheet, PFMEA and PFD in manufacturing industry and also have helped get an insight into automobile manufacturing sector in India.","projectContribution":" The implementation of TMPS guidelines in case of documentation process helps engineers across the plants to assess the operations involved in making of a part. For example we can take the case of GOEM Engine which is manufactured in Jamshedpur Plant but is sent to Pune plant for dressing. In this case Pune engineers wanted PFD, PFMEA and Process Sheet of the GOEM engine to ascertain what has happened before they carry out the information. Since the documentation and its format is same across all plants all you have to send is relevant documents via email (office 365). The operations and Potential failure modes are easily understood by engineers in Pune and now they have an idea of what happens in Jamshedpur Plant. So if a problem arises on their side the error can be targeted and could be resolved by both plants if it happens due to some faulty action being done in Jamshedpur. PLM and NPP interface even fulfills that need by sharing all the relevant documents PFD (in form of Estimate sheet) and Process Sheet (made on NPP) on a common database. In other words an engineer in Pune does not even have to ask as he or she can access it on Computer through PLM Database.

Moving the plugins into a common area gives us advantage of generalizing the scripts and reducing the space and time used for the build of the chip. The chip is partitioned mainly into four areas CPU, GPU, System and top level. There are many interconnections among these partitions. An output from one partition may become the input for different partitions or for the same partition. So, for these connections many buffers are used to differentiate between the signals. The project focusses mainly on the methodology to solve the routing problems faced by the chip by checking the necessity of buffers for all the inputs and outputs of the partitions and thereby adding or removing the buffers. RTL Netlist Audit is a framework which is used to run scripts that check various aspects of our hardware designs. It was first developed to run on netlist and later on being expanded to also run checks on RTL. It enables catching and fixing issues earlier rather than after synthesis or further down in the flow.

I analyzed the audience traffic that converted for that campaign in not only contextual and semantic terms but also by further combining the two. I carried out a URL level audience analysis by combining and extrapolating the SQL data for site domain analyses, but at the URL level. It involved the matching of keywords in the URL that are highly relevant to the campaign to ad word-groups that are most searched for on the internet. I used Google Ad Words and Latent Semantic Indexing to extract the keywords that best suited the generic nature of the advertiser’s campaign. 2) My more recent project involves furthering the reach of User Journey Analysis. The aim is to be able to tell a story of sorts that conveys each step a user takes before eventually converting on the advertiser’s confirmation page, but in deeper details that ever before. To be able to pinpoint the specifics of the user’s browsing details rather than just giving overall site domains. The project aims at combining the expertise of URL data extraction to the recency report to be able to draw a map between the time before conversion and the exact data viewed by a user, including the content he/she browses and/or the product he/she purchases, before viewing an advertisement for the campaign and finally converting. The project will give deeper insights into which site domains have been truly instrumental in driving conversions.

The migration scripts to support the same shall aid in seamless transition to the Cassandra database from MySQL database. 2.  The project was instrumental in removing components of meeting history related information from the ownership of MeetMe Service, to the ownership of newly created Meeting History Service. This not only helped in proper segregation of the code and its components, but also helped to make the product to become more robust, by increasing the abstraction between different services. It also helped to promote accountability for any code changes, since each service is now under the responsibility of programmers responsible for maintaining its smooth functioning.","futureScope":"  Lectures on Message Brokers and NoSQL Databases"},{"name":"ISHAAN RACHIT DWIVEDI .","idno":"2011B2A8626G","email":"f2011626@goa.bits-pilani.ac.in","domain":"Mathematics","broadArea":"Analysis","projectTitle":" Business and Data Analytics","subArea":" Business and Data Analytics","objective":"  Performing different kinds of analytical tests on company&apos;s database","natureOfWork":"  New Product Development, Improvement in productivity and efficiency","summary":"   Data Analytics projects implementing various analysis techniques on all of the company&apos;s data.

The board provided had communication peripherals like I2C, I2S, UART, Ethernet. The project dealt with providing a pcm sinewave file input which will be played through the Audio out of the Board. The KC705 FPGA board has a main board and a daughter board. The main board has the processor core installed on it (in this case HiFi3 DSP core), the data from the input file is brought onto the board, processed and then sent to the daughter board for audio play out. The communication between main and process board is via I2C. The 2nd Project deals with the Realtek ALC5677 Board. On this board the objective was to get an xAF(xtensa Architecture Framework)  based example working on the board. Xtensa framework is used along with an RTOS, in our case it was the Cadence XOS. The xos has 2 main libraries Libxos.a and libxos-dbg.a which have to be built initially.

During testing I got to know about the concept of dithering and the importance of buffer size. If the buffer doesn’t have an integral number of audio input samples then it will either produce a glitch or a silent tone. The glitch is produced when the size of buffer is less than required whereas a silent tone is produced when the size of buffer is more than required. On the Realtek Board, I got to know about the importance of Linker scripts, memory maps associated with them and how necessary it is to make the code fit within the memory.

However, there is a need to develop similar models for the 5th percentile female to address the larger driving population. The OS-HBM team is currently developing a model for the 5th percentile female known as the THUMSD_AF05. I am working on this model. To ensure the biofidelity of these models, certain validation tests are performed on these models. These are virtual simulations and consist of pendulum tests, crash sled tests and full body validation tests. Some of the full body tests are directed at validating the biofidelity of the thorax (chest and upper abdomen) of the model. These tests are known as Table Top Tests because they mimic the boundary condition in which the body is laid flat on a table and loading is done on the chest, to check the thoracic response that is the applied force vs chest compression characteristics. These consists of three tests, namely: 1. Hub Loading Condition (to mimic the case in which the steering wheel impacts the thorax of the driver during crash) 2. Single Belt Loading Condition (to mimic the effect of a 3-point single belt) 3. Double Belt Loading Condition (to mimic the effect of a 4-point double belt) The current model under development for the 5th percentile female, THUMSD_AF05 is not validated against these table top tests. The main aim of my project is to validate the model against these tests. There are corridors (statistical one standard deviation limits) available on the force-deflection curves for the 50th percentile male for validation. However none are available for the 5th percentile female. So the methodology I followed for my project is as follows: 1. Literature survey conducted to get the force-deflection data for the 5th percentile female for the table top tests. 2. Development of biofidelity corridors on the force-deflection curves for validation, by taking the above female data and using appropriate scaling and statistical techniques. 3. Checking the thoracic response of the intial model against these developed corridors. Model response outside the corridor, need for improvement. 4. Identifying the key components of the thorax, by studying the force and internal energy transfer through the thorax region. 5. Varying the material properties of these components, within the physiological limits, so as to improve the response of the model. 6. Checking the modified model response against the earlier developed corridors. 7. Steps 4-6 were repeated in an iterative process to arrive at a modified model with improved thoracic response which falls within the developed corridors. During the course of my project, I have gained immense knowledge in the field of FEA and working of the crash safety department of an automobile manufacturing company.

This was done on the basis of their performance in recent months and Annual Purchase Volume. We chose suppliers with a balance of both as implementing WCSQ at a highly performing supplier would not lead to great improvements and it would not be worth the effort, time and money to implement WCSQ at a supplier from whom Tata Motors does not buy significant amount of parts. Some suppliers requested a training session before beginning implementation of WCSQ. After training them, they were asked to provide a time plan for implementation of various principles of WCSQ. Then as implementation began, we periodically visited the suppliers to audit the progress in order to ensure timely completion. After completing implementation, the supplier has to do a self-assessment audit and if they clear it, a team from Tata Motors will conduct a final audit. However, just implementation of principles does not guarantee WCSQ certification; the supplier needs to perform well consistently and then they receive the title of Preferred Quality Supplier. For my project, cost reduction was achieved through the following levers: • Design change: Changes in design can reduce costs by using lesser or cheaper materials, making their manufacturing easier or a complete change in the technology. • Alternate sourcing: Supplier can be changed if another supplier is offering the same part at a lower price. • Commonization: Differentiation in parts increases manufacturing and design costs, therefore it should only exist where necessary. Cost reduction is a continuous activity and therefore, some of the ideas I worked on had already been identified while I also suggested some new ones. The components involved in these ideas were some of the components that my mentor, Mr. Sachin Moralwar’s group handled. For any change to be implemented in a component it needs to be approved by various internal agencies to make sure it does not adversely affect the quality or commercial aspects of a vehicle. My task was to speed up the implementation process by coordinating with and assisting various internal agencies and suppliers.

In chemotaxis their food has been used as a chemoattractant to see the response of firstly an intact planarian and then a headless planarian .This is done basically to study the role and significance of the neural activity to the chemotactic behavior shown by the planarian.

Through Electrotaxis we learnt about the Planarian movement and how is it affected at different intensities of current .Similarly through thermotaxis we learnt how the planarian locomotor activity gets affected at varied ranges of temperature. These experiments help us to conclude that the neural system plays a significant role in the stimuli sensing behaviors of the planarian worm. And we also observe that if the neural activity gets disrupted the stimuli sensing ability of the planarian also gets destroyed.

The Audio Equalizer is a part of the post processor module, presently being developed by a part of the Audio team in Pune. The project involves two audio equalizers, one is a basic test example and the other is the one used in the Android 5.1.0 version. Both the equalizers are a part of the android open source code. For the test example the code being in C++ needs to be written in C language and then tested for its functionalities and behaviors. The project on the first equalizer ends here. The second equalizer (the one used in android) needed to be built on Visual Studio and then on GCC and finally on XCC (Xtensa Compiler). Implementation on Xtensa involves optimization of the code to achieve minimum number of cycles during processing. Optimization is done function by function and bit exactness needs to be maintained with the original code. The final task involves wrapping the library with standard API and test bench, and testing its functionalities. In the testing of Equalizers features involves cleanup of the code, running error detection scripts. The behavior of the equalizer is thoroughly studied for bit exactness with the reference C code which is compiled on GCC. After this, documentation of the features and statistics that the Audio Equalizer provides takes place.","natureOfWork":"  New Product Development","summary":" Implemented android reference code of audio equalizer on Xtensa.

This project also explains the different components of the regulatory Reporting and discuss why regulatory reporting is such a crucial part of every organization and what exactly is the work flow of Regulatory Reporting.","natureOfWork":"  This work is generally focused on testing and reporting part of the business. Improvement in the productivity of company is dependent on the efficiency of this work because this department as such does not generate any profits but a regulatory and trade support work to push the trade down the cycle so basically it eats the company funds. There is a lot of scope for improvement and efficiency in this area by centralizing the reporting hubs and separate them from daily trade support. Infact I was working on MIS Integration to create a centralized hub of reporting but can not disclose any of the information here due to contractual aggrement.","summary":"  I have learnt the importance of regulatory reporting, why it is important and how regulatory reporting is done and managed. I have gained very good exposure of the operations side of the financial services and one of the most important thing is this part of the business is equally important as compare to the Front office. I have also witnessed many cases where small mistake done in reporting work by the analyst has led to financial impact of thousands of dollars.  Apart from that this is the basic summary of the importance of regulatory reporting: As a part of regulations and compliances, it is required by the organization to perform appropriate analysis and report any suspicious activities that may lead to fraud and money laundering, to the Regulatory Authorities. These regulatory bodies are responsible for safeguarding financial institutions and consumers from abuse, providing transparency in the country&apos;s financial system, enhancing that country&apos;s security, and deterring and detecting criminal activity in the financial system. As part of this goal, the Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) or regulatory bodies require the financial institutions to provide data regarding suspicious activities that lead to fraud and money laundering in a financial institution. This data is delivered to the regulatory bodies through regulatory reports or suspicious transaction reports (STR). Regulatory Reporting (RR) supports the creation and management of the Suspicious Transaction Report for Pakistan. The application supports generation of suspicious transaction reports or STR in the following two formats: PDF and CSV.","projectContribution":"  This project contributed a lot in increasing the efficiency of the fixed Income department and hence the organization. Working as the part of regulatory reporting team I worked on MIS Integration to follow up with managers of different teams and to held regular meetings with the team heads to devise a plan to restructure their teams and increase the efficiency of JPMorgan Chase as whole and create a centralized hub of reporting. I completed some part of this very diverse project and went on to create the centralized hub of reporting. So this project which I have explained very little in the project report due to confidential information has actually made a significant impact on the organization and increased the efficiency of the team.","futureScope":"  There is not much scope for further collaboration with the organization on the core finance side but a lot of collaborations can be done on the operations side of the company. JPMorgan Chase India is a hub of regulatory and trade support reporting and when the organization is this vast and diverse there’s  always a scope for further improvement and increase the efficiency of the company. For Ex: I see a lot of potential on restructuring the teams and create a centralized hubs by which all of the work can be specialized and monotonous work can be separated from the bit more interesting part ie trade support. So a lot of research can be done on this part and centre of excellence can be created out of this project which will be a stepping stone for JPMorgan India to manage this feat."},{"name":"RAHUL REDDY KOMATIREDDI","idno":"2012A2PS468H","email":"f2012468@hyderabad.bits-pilani.ac.in","domain":"-","broadArea":"-","projectTitle":" 1.

I made my system work in a compressed bandwidth of 120MHz. I successfully implemented the entire system addressing all these issues. I now have the complete idea of how a digital signal behaves at each and every point of a communication system.","projectContribution":" Provided a platform base for the upcoming standard. The project can now be expanded for other multi carrier modulation types also, like OFDM.","futureScope":" Since this project requires good expertise in concepts of communications, as well as programming in LabVIEW, working on it will need deep understanding of academics and competence in enforcing them through LabVIEW.

Unit testing is a level of software development where individual components of a software are tested. ULT is playing a pivotal role in Software Development. Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time which is used to recall specific versions later. There are many version control systems but GIT is a very fast and reliable and hence it is widely used. Several GIT commands are studied and utilized in transporting Test cases which are uploaded to GITHUB, an Intel Corporation online repo. Executing the test cases after syncing the repository is one way. But executing multiple test cases one after the other by mere selecting a job is quicker and simpler. This is what iTest framework does. Static Analysis (SA) is a fact of life in a modern software (SW) development process. Static program analysis is the analysis of computer software that is performed without actually executing programs. The objective is to understand an overview of SA, its uses and how KlocWorks serves as an SA tool.","natureOfWork":"  Development of Source Code.","summary":"  In this project, I learnt why ULT is important, how and where the test cases are written and how they are sent back to the online repository where every other employee can make use of those Test Cases and the use of KlocWork as SA tool and its Installation Topography.

This process is called carburization of cell and is of utmost importance to be avoided. The reaction is called Boudouard reaction 2CO ? CO2 + C Since methane is highly researched hydrocarbon fuel, it is appropriate to start out with methane. The results obtained after the MATLAB analysis could be matched with literature and then similar procedure could be expanded to heavier hydrocarbons such as dodecane. The approach remains the same and this can be applied to any hydrocarbon fuel if the necessary data is available In this project, once the reformed product and its composition is known, an extensive COMSOL model will be made that includes all the aspects from current produced to heat generated in cell. It is found that as we keep increasing the reforming ratio of the hydrocarbon, i.e. ratio of moles of steam to moles of the hydrocarbon, the chances of carbon deposition decrease. So at different steam to carbon ratios, efficiency and the EMF can be found. Also since we can find the boundary of carburization, we know which conditions to avoid the carbon formation. Including all these findings, an optimum condition can be found for the cell to operate wherein maximum output can be obtained","natureOfWork":"  My project was research based and modeling of cell","summary":"  A MATLAB program that can provide with the equilibrium composition of a hydrocarbon fuel after reforming has been developed. Running this program at different compositions and at different temperatures,we can find the parameters which theoretically give high efficiency, output (in terms of EMF) and the least or zero carbon deposition can be initiated. Having the right composition, a COMSOL model was developed that incorporated hydrocarbon fuel. COMSOL had an in-built model of an SOFC that by default uses pure hydrogen as fuel and air on the cathode. After understanding the basic working and analysis, hydrocarbon fuels were incorporated. A lot of parameters had to be taken care of because now instead of pure hydrogen, a reformed product entered the fuel chamber (mixture of CH4, CO, CO2, H2, H2O) at a fixed temperature of 1073K. The COMSOL modeled with the data provided by the MATLAB code can then be used to do the analysis of any hydrocarbon fuel. Simulations can be done by varying different parameters and the model will give accurate composition and temperature profiles. The study can be extended to multichannel cells also. With further studies, a chemical reaction module can be incorporated that can take into account the drop in catalytic activity due to carbon deposition with time. This model will require minor changes and will be helpful in finding the most suitable fuel replacement for pure hydrogen.","projectContribution":" My project has improved upon the model that was initially available to them by incorporating hydrocarbon fuel.

I was assigned this project under the mentorship of Mr Satyen Phule and guidance of Mr. Deepak Patil. I was assigned to fulfil 4 Deliverables during my course of period 1. Study of High PPM parts. 2. Identify Parts requiring improvements and implementation of corrective actions. 3. Verification of Corrective actions and establish future control over the processes. 4. Verification of results I was assigned the vendor SPW – Suresh Press Works which supplies 93 parts to PVBU (car plant). For the first few weeks, I worked with sankalp team to learn the fundamentals of part study like dwg study, PFMEA study, Control Plan study, part inspection as per dwg, process audit as per control plan, PDI improvement, Pareto analysis, defect analysis etc. Next for the remaining course of time I undertook the part study of 5 High PPM parts where I did the process study and defect analysis using tools like why – why analysis, Ishikawa diagram and Pareto charts etc. Once the causes of the defects were known I did the root cause validation for these problems to successfully prepare an action plan for the same. Once the corrective actions were taken we established a control plan so that the problem does not occur on future. During my internship period, apart from the quality tools, I learnt about various manufacturing process involved like Forming, Punching, Blanking, CO2 welding, Brazing, Electroplating, CNC bending, manual bending, Reaming, Flaring etc.","projectContribution":"  The reduction in PPM / Rejection from supplier ensures that defective parts will not reach TATA MOTORS. Installation of defective parts causes poor quality and customer complaints,also Its a loss of valuable capital for the company as some time the productions lines have to stopped because of defective parts. Improving supplier quality will Increase profitability of Tata Motors and also keep the customers happy.","futureScope":"  Project Sankalp Is a new Initiative by Tata Motors and many news suppliers will be added under this Project.

It has always been seen by investors as a non-cyclical defensive sector, but we believe this is no longer the case. In the 1980s, food retailers with negative working capital benefited from high inflation and high interest rates. In the 1990s, sector performance was driven by international expansion and consolidation in mature markets. The top five market shares now exceed 50% in the main European countries. Food retail sector is one of the most price competitive industries as the margins are very low in grocery and other food items and there is little to no differentiation in products, so to attract buyers, companies need to invest in prices (should have the lowest basket price with respect to competitors) by providing several promotional schemes and offers. Price investment is also necessary for large retailers to maintain their market share which is currently under immense pressure from discounters as they are gaining momentum and market share in UK and other European countries. The gaining popularity of discounters is because they are situated very close to the actual buyers and provide heavy discounts on various private and branded products. Current trend in food retail market in UK seems to be pretty tough with heavy competition among the Big 4 (Tesco, Sainsbury, Morrison and Asda); threat of new entrants (like Amazon Fresh); discounters (Aldi, Lidl, etc) and gaining popularity of Online and Click & Collect format over the traditional bricks and mortar stores.","projectContribution":"  Project is exactly what the department (global research center) does in their normal day to day work which includes making news dailies, tracking earnings release of various companies, working on IPOs, preparing macro economic reports that affects the coverage companies and solving clients requests.","futureScope":" There is huge scope for collaborations with the organisation and Bulls and Bears club of BITS Pilani Hyderabad in which the club can learn the complete procedure of Fundamental research done for various sectors."},{"name":"SIDDHARTHJamkar","idno":"2012A4PS013G","email":"f2012013@goa.bits-pilani.ac.in","domain":"Mechanical","broadArea":"Supply chain Management","projectTitle":" PPM  reduction and resolving Eagle Quality issues","subArea":" Supplier Quality","objective":"  1.\tStudy of high PPM parts under Utility vehicles section and reducing the equivalent PPM by dealing with the suppliers. 2.\tResolving Current Quality issues in Project EAGLE.","natureOfWork":"   Improvement in the productivity and efficiency of the product & services","summary":" I played an active role in improving part quality of three suppliers.

To tackle this problem, a method has been developed which automates the above process. With a minimal effort of specifying few parameters like maximum number of repeaters, even or odd number of repeaters and the tool taking care of rest of the task, this procedure helps ease down the manual effort and hence saves time. (2)\tScalable and modular validation framework of a CDC unit: With each passing generation of graphics hardware, the need for scalable and modular design is becoming paramount.

To test our skills, we had to develop an Online Bookstore and apply all our skills learnt in training, in developing  that project. After our training I was allotted to K-Registry, where I was supposed to work for Reflexis Task manager team. The Reflexis Retail Execution Platform is made up of four suites:  Merchandising Operations, Store Operations, Vendor Operations, and  Retail Execution Support. Reflexis Task Manager(RTM) is part of the Store  Operations suite. The Reflexis Task Manager is a web based application used by retail  organisations to support the planning, execution, and management of  projects. Users of this system will access it through their desktop’s web browser. The primary function of this application is to increase sales and cut  costs of the retail stores by employing retail strategy for store level action  with closed loop management(i.e. with active feedback). It consolidates the  store-level execution of retail objectives by providing ?exposure of task compliance to field and corporate managers. The role of SQl and databases was deeply studied by me in my  project. I studied how to debug a code in Eclipse and extract SQl  statements for documentation . I also learnt the process of making reports  through Cognos report Studio, and i&apos;m greatly benefited with that  information.","projectContribution":" The Cognos Reports offer more flexibility and security than RTM Dailyplanner blocks in viewing information.

The bias error of a rate gyro is the signal output from the gyro when it is not experiencing any rotation. The drift varies significantly with temperature. This project involves designing a model which successfully predicts the offset using Kalman filtering. During the course of the project, variants of Kalman filter were also studied in detail in order to arrive at an appropriate variant which effectively reduces the offset or filters it out.

As it has high energy requirements and capital costs, a new method, the application of a Dividing Wall Column is proposed. It is an up-and- coming technology that has been implemented in various refineries and existing literature (Othman & Illner, 2014) suggests that there is a scope to save up to more than 30% energy compared to the conventional separation techniques. It is simulated in Aspen HYSYS using 4 columns instead of the traditional method of two or three columns for a more accurate representation.","natureOfWork":"  The project aims to focus on the development of a more efficient method for the separation of ternary mixtures.

The second study could be used to understand the effect of the wall position and thus can be simulated for other mixtures having different behaviors. The DWC are being currently used in some of the Indian industries though minimal data exists in open literature which takes into consideration all the equipment and operating conditions involved in an actual industry.","futureScope":"  The first step would be to study the possible control factors involved with a DWC.

Our training sessions gave us a good idea about what aspects of Excel we needed for our day-to-day work. First, an overview of the shortcuts needed for quick Excel operation was told to us. Further, the following operations in Excel were touched upon with varying degrees of detail: •\tPivot Tables (Entitlements vs. Deployments) •\tVlookup •\tFiltering Finally, we were taught how to combine huge piles of data using CMD or Command Prompt. Smart Cities We evaluated ‘smart’ buildings across various sectors based on 3 factors: Green, Safe and Productive. This was done across 20 cities. This taught us the importance of constructing environmental-friendly and energy-effective buildings so our nation’s infrastructure might get better. PC count factor Our Secondary project was to estimate the ‘PC Count Factor’ for the IT/ ITES sector and compare it with the Finance/Legal, Manufacturing and Education Sectors. This ‘PC Count Factor’ is the number of PCs per employee. It was found to be highest for the IT/ ITES sector (1.02) and lowest for the manufacturing sector (0.31) Client Interaction An on-site visit with one of our customers gave us a hands-on experience about reviewer-client interaction. A comprehensive report of gaps (entitlements vs deployments) was made. Research and Profiling Our Primary project was ‘Research on Prospective Clients for KPMG’.

The open-sourced, low cost and customizable nature has made way for it to be put to use in the automotive industry as well. The first phase of the project involved development of IVI shell on Weston, a reference implementation of Wayland and adapting applications to run on the IVI-shell using hmi-controller module. The application developed in this process enables users to interact with clients using touch gestures on a touchscreen display device. The second phase of the project is aimed at developing concurrent displays for a fluid and easy-to-use user interface (UI) for Linux based in-vehicle infotainment systems. The concurrency enables overlaying, managing and operating multiple display contexts for a better user experience. As a part of this project first video playback was enabled in gl-consumer mode of operation followed by capturing of live video from camera/DVD player.

High-performance, power-efficient processors are required to deliver the types of experiences users demand. High end graphics and fluid interfaces play a key role in enriching that experience. The NVIDIA Tegra K1 processor creates a major discontinuity in the state of mobile visual computing by incorporating the industry’s fastest and most power efficient GPU architecture. A benchmarking and testing standard for such visual engines only makes sense in such a scenario.

This experience has given me a whole new perspective about the above mentioned industries, especially since each of the industries has had several forces acting on it which is threatening to change the dynamics of the respective industries. The following report will talk about these dynamics in the industry, how things have changed and my takeaways.","natureOfWork":"  The project was basically the day to day work done by analysts in the Global research center of JP Morgan India (Equity research department), which is to support covering analysts all over the world.","summary":"  As far as the Oil & Gas Industry is concerned, the biggest mistake that oil and gas companies can make in this difficult business landscape is to focus solely on reducing costs (either operating or general and administrative) and spending; this strategy is effective only in a very narrow range of market conditions and rarely effective enough to make businesses successful over the long term. Rather, companies should carefully consider the supply of assets, analyze the logistics of accessing available markets, and ensure a long-term presence in these markets without getting into a bidding war. Oversupply and lower prices represent a real challenge to the industry, but that doesn’t mean the future is all gloom. It just means that producers and refiners need to be prepared and adopt strategies that take advantage of the new reality. In the Telecom Industry, mobile operators are increasingly drawn towards consolidation to overcome demanding market conditions by focusing on minimizing costs. Attractive valuations are another big fuelling factor alongside availability of debt at low interest rates and the willingness of banks to underwrite debt to ensure deals go through. Consolidation is an effective way for operators to respond to the increasing demand for new digital content and technologies. By forming mergers, smaller companies can combine their services to boost the network, offer a more efficient service to consumers and move forward with new technology to develop or maintain a competitive edge. This was seen in the British telecoms sector with mobile operator EE, formerly Everything Everywhere. This is the product of consolidation between Britain’s third and fourth largest mobile operators, Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile unit and France Telecom’s Orange. Merging the two operators boosted the company to Britain’s largest mobile network and launched them ahead of the competition by being one of the first operators to offer 4G to UK customers. In Europe regulators are faced with the ongoing challenge of identifying the number of operators that are optimal for market growth. Consolidation has been faced with a number of regulatory burdens imposed by 28 national telecom regulators, 28 national competition regulators and the European Commission. The EC has recently announced they are looking to encourage consolidation of these 100 operators to increase investment in infrastructure, which has significantly dropped in comparison to countries, such as the US and Asia, with fewer mobile providers. Coming to Food Retail, though online grocery has been around for years, it is only now starting to gain traction in major markets. Our analysis suggests these formats can be profitable in much of the US and Western Europe. Their evolution in France and the UK shows how fast they can grow, and now major players such as AmazonFresh are investing heavily in the US and Germany. Even in markets where online grocery is relatively mature, new and well- capitalized entrants could make a significant impact. The growth of this format does not mean the end of bricks-and-mortar grocery, but it will be highly disruptive. As established players lose market share, stores will need to close, while in many cases the stores that remain may become more profitable than before as local rivals disappear. Bricks-and-mortar grocers therefore should focus not on outrunning the “bear” of online grocery but rather on outrunning the person next to them, their local competition. Although online grocery certainly poses a threat to a bricks-and-mortar grocer, it also presents an opportunity. Bricks- and-mortar grocers have assets, brands, and expertise that can be used to launch an online business more rapidly than an online-only player. While entering the online business is clearly risky, it can also allow an established retailer to reach new customers, serve different purchase occasions, and increase loyalty. Bricks-and-mortar stores should carefully consider the opportunity to start, grow, and upgrade their online offerings to take advantage.","projectContribution":"  Project contribution was directly to the day to day working of my department.

I often have to perform A/B tests on product ads to see if a change in the ad copy (Ex. Ad image, headline, description line or structure) will lead to more traction for ads. Through this procedure, I learnt how to use JSON GET/POST calls to modify images through an AdCreative service that our tech team constructed. The AdCreative service has a multitude of usages such as: ? Adding Frames (Borders) to images ? Auto filling background with colors that contrast the remaining image ? Performing Product Focus (Trimming Image borders and magnifying images) ? Using Transparency function (Removing background pixels from the images) This has taken me through quite a bit of scripting including JAVA, XML, etc. and performed ANOVA analysis, Bayesian Statistical calculations and several tailed tests to check if the obtained data was significant or not. Making sense of data is a core part of my job in Sokrati, and I try to learn newer ways of data interpretation to see if results of tests launched by me come within a 90/95% significance level. I used XML to create videos for several clients using API calls. The videos use images as transition and have a flowing presentation feel to them. Each element of the video can be modified to suit the aesthetics of a continuum and several stacks of images/texts/audio parts make a single sequence for the video. I created videos for: ? 99 Acres (70 Sec Videos of Properties to be sold) ? Proptiger (70 Sec Videos) ? Tolexo (45 Sec Videos of different measuring instruments) Here are the notes I think are important: ? Mobile deeplinking happens through creating Schemes inside apps and assigning them link addresses. This step has to be taken up by the client. ? We can use free services such as &Double;Branch Metrics&Double; to create modified links that will detect platform and direct the end user towards the corresponding location. ? Here, Branch Metrics will help detect if the person has the particular app or not and on that basis send the user to a specific app page, or the app store. ? Appsflyer (alternative solution to Branch, but charges money on installs) will need the integration of an SDK inside the client&apos;s app so that tracking can be done (to see if end user went to &Double;Add to cart&Double; app page or any other significant level in the in-app environment). ? In case we have deeplink URIs (provided by the clients), we can still use them inside PLA feeds to redirect end users to app pages but tracking wont be followed. Also, these deeplink URIs will be platform specific (Ex. Android URI won&apos;t work on other platforms and vice versa). NOTE: Test has been performed on facebook, instagram and other apps to open app homepages using link created through Branch Metrics. App homepages often don&apos;t require permissions and can be opened by simply writing their main app URI. https://bnc.lt/sokrates This link will open FB in iOS and Android if installed. For windows web browsers it takes you to yahoo.com website.","projectContribution":"  Improved bidding mechanisms throughout all clients in Sokrati. Produced video ads for several new clients.

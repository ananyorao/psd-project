Not only because it is in a new country, but also due to the company and work culture.We got to work in a company where you can see both the plant operator and Company President eat beside each other. Where our mentors are not Assistant Managers, but Assistant Vice Presidents, and we interns were given the same respect and treatment as any other employee. Such is the atmosphere there!Initially when we arrived, we were a little scared and unsure of our role here. But once the projects were assigned and work started, we slowly got comfortable. The best part was that we were not given anykind of spoon feeding. We were taught to expect help only in things related to the plant. No one told us where to find a solution, only that we had to find one. And this was the biggest factor in helping us transition from Academic Learning to Industrial Application.Working in the projects department in Phosphates Division, we were assigned either old unsolved cases for giving a fresh perspective, or a new problem which needed a solution. When giving our first report, our mentor checked it so thoroughly that it surprised us. That was the time we realized that they were not just keeping us busy, but actually expecting practical solutions from us. This renewed our zeal to work hard for any and every task given to us. The motivation that stems from seeing your work appreciated was greatly felt, especially by the fact that the company was considering implementing our solutions. And this was true of all of us. The interns working in the Saraburi plants have achievements to boast of as well. At the Thai Peroxideplant, production has improved by 2 MT/day, and at the Sulphites division, the feasibility analysis for a new product will help them expand into a new 3 Billion $ market. Each of us was also involved with preparations for the 'World Class Manufacturing Awards' assessment, which is an initiative of the Aditya Birla Group. And when our plants won their respective awards, we felt proud to have been able to contribute.As for life outside of the work place, we were living in a completely new and unknown country, where we initially couldn't speak the local language. We had 23 weeks in front of us, and we livedthem one week at a time. We were part of a good routine which kept us in top mental and physical health. And it is definitely the best thing that happened to us. On the weekends, which we internsspent together, we would explore a new fascinating place, try out some unique and amazing food and gathered memories worth remembering for the rest of our lives. We got afirsthand experience of Thai culture and living, while working in an amazing environment. It really was a dream come true PS for us.To conclude, I would like to recommend this place as an option for all Mechanical and Chemical Engineering students who want to experience working somewhere youwill feel independent and important. Our sincere thanks to PS division and to Aditya Birla Chemicals (Thailand) Ltd. for this opportunity and good luck to the student readers."},{"domain":"Chemical Engineering","company":"Atul ltd. , Valsad, Gujarat","name":"Bibhu Padarabinda Nayak","id":"2011B1A1675G","feedback":"ATUL LTD. is the oldest privately owned chemical organization in fact the first private chemical company to be established after Indian independence. The techniques used in the manufacture of various colors, dyes, paints& other reactive intermediates help a chemical engineer to practically see whatever he/she's been taught theoretically through books. The vast amount of operations or rather unit operations taking place in every process are critical to the understanding levels of a student. It serves as the best platform for the foundation of conceptually strong chemical engineers because the basics are polished and it helps one to implement these concepts into progressing into a project further and advanced developments.The engineers as well as the highly qualified operators here at ATUL helped us in understanding the processes taking place as well as where were they related to in the field of chemical engineering. The books namely \"Mcabe smith\" and \"Treybol\" were referred to incase there were a few problems in clarity or understanding. But the expertise of the above mentioned people hardly let us face any kind of problems. Frequent on site visits, online course referrals, deliberate meetings as well as consultations with various departments made the 51/2 month experience a fruitful one.Speaking from the point of view of a fresh graduate, industrial experience isn't just about working on projects or other academics related stuff.It is about the etiquettes and manners to work in a corporate environment, how to manage yourselves formally, learning to live by the company rules and regulations and learning to behave accordingly. That switch of lifestyle is what defines industrial experience. Also the capability to think out of the box, practicality as well as problem handling efficiency are also required tools for a successful career.The trained and experienced engineers over at ATUL were extremely patient and understanding towards us in case we had any problem understanding a process taking place, just being in groups, listening to their conversations, deliberate meetings between the variousdepartment heads and frequent on site visits did raise our intellectual levels and helped us have a firm grasp over things happening and the day to day happenings in the plant. The concepts learnt previously actually started making sense.At the end of our training period, we can confidently walk into any core chemical industry without being hassled and unaware of various unit operations that happen over there, also the exposure at ATUL has made us strong identifying as well as designing various equipment that are principally used in a chemical industry like distillation columns, cooling towers, reaction vessels (CSTRS &PFRS), filter presses and etc. Now without any further struggles we can explore things for ourselves and can actually contribute towards the development of any company that we settle into because our training has been that solidand overall top notch.The industry is divided into various sheds under which the production of numerous intermediates takes place. Each such shed has its own processes and equipment. Therefore, problems are bound to happen.one such problem was with merging two intermediates namely (528 &542) each of whom required me to draft a separate p&id after studying their process and finally merging the products to create an entirely new product (quinizarine), i had to draft the entire process, scout the equipments , make a list of whatever was to be needed. So made a list and asked to place the order after further reviews. The amount billed was about 0.12cr, and after the equipments arrived, trials were held and right now the product is feasible.Secondly, there’s another interprocess discrepancy resolved by me. (int 528) could be broken into two finished products namely528p and 529, where the production of 528p was being done with excessive losses(about 60% of input ), i proposed a change in mechanism where i asked for further acidification in the secondary step by concentrated h2so4 and then passing it through filter press with a brine wash, thereby lowering the acididty and therefore decreasing the water added in the previous step and also being able to recovera major proportion of the product without letting them being washed away with water. My idea was reviewed and it was found to be chemically sound. Trials are being awaited. If this happens, the company can decrease the product wastage by about 10-15% as well as increase yield as well as quality."},{"domain":"Chemical Engineering","company":"Grasim Industries Limited, Nagda","name":"Varun Patel","id":"2012A1PS328P","feedback":"Edited by: Samir Kale, Assistant Professor (OC) and Faculty Incharge, Grasim Industries Limited, NagdaDuring my PS at the viscose staple fibre division of Grasim Industries, Nagda, I studied the viscose manufacturing process and sodium sulphate production in detail. The study of the process operations helped me study the difference at the industrial level from the academic knowledge. The continuous research for the projects helped me refresh the basics of chemical engineeringalong the way. During the PS, I learnt working with a number of engineers from different branches with a lot of industrial experience as a team.The PS experience also taught me how to trouble-shoot real-life problems faced in the plant on a day-to-day basis. It gave me a glimpseon the type of work I will be doing in the future. This will help me in the transition from academic to industry more quickly and effectively. I think that the things I learnt from the PS will prove to be invaluable for the future.Major Achievement/Contributions:The project was on the multi-stage flash evaporators (MSFE) which are used in the auxiliary department to remove the excess water in the spin bath to maintain its concentration. The aim of this project is to improve the performance of MSFE by decreasing the steam requirement and increasing the capacity of the MSFE. It also focuses on suggesting methods to improve the heater performance. Some of the sulphur from the spin bath is flashed with the water from the spin bath and is circulated through the shell side of the heater. On cooling down, it gets deposited on the outer side of the tubes. This salt and sulphur deposition in the heat exchanger decreases the steam economy.Due to this, caustic circulation is carried out every 20-30 days in the heaters of the MSFE to remove the sulphur and scale of the tubes and improve the heat transfer.Suggestions: Caustic circulation removes the salt and sulphur deposits from the tubes but italso causes damage to the rubber lining of the preheaters (A-1 to A-8) in the long run. So, if we can delay the caustic circulation as long as possible without decreasing the plant performance, then the damage to the heaters can be prevented which will prolong the heater life.The following things can be tried for prevention of scale and salt deposits. (Accepted for trials at GIL)Use of low molecular weight polymers as anti-scalantsThe low molecular weight polymers are generally polymers of carboxylic acid or sulphonic acid groups with average molecular weight over 2000 g/mole. The most effective ones are polyacrylic acid, polymetacrylicacid and polymaleic acid. They are mostly used in boilers to prevent scaling. They have also been tried in some desalination plants. These polymers are added to the scale causing solution in small quantities (generally 5-30 ppm) according to the concentration of the scale causing salts. These polymers either disperse the flocs of salts formed in the solution or form a micro-film on the heat transfer surfaces.They don’t completely stop scaling but they do decrease the rate of scale formation to a great extent.How they can be applied in our MSFE: The polymers have to be tested in the laboratory tostudy their impact on fibre, spin bath and salt. If they pass the tests, then they can be added to the spin bath tanks to maintain a specific concentration. A polymer testing kit can be used to check the concentration regularly and accordingly, the polymer can be added to compensate the loss in various processes.Targeted Benefits:The polymers inhibit both salt and suspended solids deposition. So, the sulphur inthe system willalso remain in the suspended form in the spin bath. Due to scale inhibition, the caustic circulationcan be delayed and steam economy of the MSFE can be maintained for a longer time. The polymers are acidic in nature so, they can withstand low pH values. Their concentration isin ppm so, there will be no effect on the acidity and quality of the spin bath. The spin bath system is a closed system i.e. all the spin bath returns back. So, there will benegligible loss of polymers making it cost effective. The polymers will decrease the damage caused by frequent caustic circulation. It will also prevent flash vessels. "},{"domain":"Civil Engineering","company":"Central Building Research Institute (CBRI), Roorkee","name":"Yashaditya Vyas","id":"2012A2PS536P","feedback":"My 5&1/2 month experience at CBRI, Roorkee has been a great teacher to me both personally and professionally. Being a research oriented institute, CBRI did not as such gave me much with respectto industrial experience but the learning opportunities are huge here. It definitely did help me in regaining an interest in my discipline which I had begun to lose after continuous academic sessions. Seeing how my research would be used in real world applications definitely helped me appreciate the nuances of civil engineering. My work gave me exposure to FEM based analyses of real world problems which find a huge amount of application in a variety of fields including structural analysis and my career prospects look positively brighter after the PS-II. Besides the professional gains, the true gems I gained from my stay in the small town of Roorkee were rather more personal. I got to have more alone time and that gave me the time for self-reflection and rethinking my priorities which was of utmost necessity. My stay also gave me the insights into the work culture of a top level government institute, which is going to help me in making more informed career choices."},{"domain":"Civil Engineering","company":"Central Road Research Institute, New Delhi","name":"Amandeep Singh","id":"2012A2PS614P","feedback":"The major learning that I acquired in my 5 and half months of exposure at CRRI, one of country’s most prestigious institutes, are twofold. Thefirst was the technical aspect of things and the second was of character building.The technical aspects include me mastering the statistical software known as IBM SPSS andalso acquiring the skill set to tackle the problems relating to Level of service criteria that falls under Traffic Engineering and Safety. Apart from this aspect, the humility I saw in my mentor and his colleagues has left its impression on me and will help me go a long way.This time period has definitely prepared me for a future in the industrial side of civil engineering. The immediate exposure to real life problems in the industry along with responsibility attachedwith the work that I conducted has left me with a sense of professionalism and taught me office-work ethics.The project I was working on determines the level of service of the urban arterial roads in the whole of India. The sheer magnitude of the project appeared daunting at first but over time, under the guidance of Dr. A. Mohan Rao, I learned to focus my problems and solve the problem at hand one step at a time in a swift but organized way. This gave me the confidence that will in the future empower me to tackle any problem at hand. This attitude I feel will be important when I will be responsible for a complete project in the future.In my time here, I learned how to work alongside other people and learned the true meaning of teamwork and how important colleagues are in an office space. From my seniors I learned the way to guide a person working under me. The way my mentor listened to my doubts and provided me with the right amount of help, not too much but just enough to set me in a path of self discovering the solution.I would like to round by saying that working at CRRI has left me stronger both cerebrally andspiritually. This has been an experience of a life time and has definitely made a better engineer and a better person.My major accomplishments include not any medal or certificate but the trust and confidence that my mentor showed in me while doing the work load.

During our Practice School at Vakil Mehta Sheth Consulting Engineers, we gained a lot of experience in the field of structural design. There was a lot of non-textbook learning like the structural workflow for the design and execution of a project. The various technicalities involved procedures to be followed, documentation to be prepared. A major learning was the interpretation of standard codes of construction, both Indian and foreign. We also learned a lot about dealing with lateral forces, particularly seismic, their various parameters and their calculations. We also got to learn a lot about the detailing of various members. We hadn't worked with shear walls in our courses and it was a new introduction to us here, at VMS. And the same thing can be said about flat slabs also.The 5 and 1/2 months of working at VMS Consulting Engineers was a smooth transit from academia to the industry. While studying from books, we do not have a lot of clarity about the practical applications of the theory that we have learnt. However, at VMS, we got theopportunity to work on live projects and that really improved our understanding of the basic concepts.Working in the industry, as expected, is very different from studying at the institute. However, the learning opportunity and the new environment were incredible. There are a lot of things to take back, and the technical aspect is only one of them. This experience helped us build relations in the industry, something very important for any profession. The office work culture was an entirely new experience as we haven't had the opportunity to work at a single place for this long a duration.Our knowledge base was broadened merely by the experience of working here. We got a full overview of how a project is initiated, what the role of the structural design consultant is, how that role can be further expanded etc. Something invaluable that we gained was an understanding of the way of a professional structural engineer role in the vast process of construction. The perception of general public of a civil work is merely limited to site work. But we experienced how structural engineers work is crucial for smooth, efficient and timely completion of a project.This time has helped me realize that work we learned is of great significance in the entire construction work. The importance of work has helped me be more inclined towards the construction industry. I also want to be involved with some research project which consists of both research scholars and practical engineers and work towards making the complete cycle more efficient. I would love to work in some startup in structural industry, where our work will not be limited to structural design but various types of work for my complete professional development.This time helped me learn how to work in a professional condition.

I understood how important my basic concepts need to be for the other person and myself to be on the same page when discussing about something. PS-2 was our first application of theoretical knowledge to practical and it is very important for theory to be well understood to proceed with designing anything out of that theory. Industrialexperience from academics was a welcome break and it made me realize that here there is no short-cut and everything needs to be really accurate. I think this experience willmake my second transition -from industry back to academics for next 6 months really different from how I approached my previous academic courses. This is what I will be taking back from my experience here. You keep on working till you come up with a solution, a correct one. Also, I would like to share here about how I realized inter-disciplinary knowledge is important for industrial work! It is not sufficient sometimes to know about only one thing –but to know some things about all and be good at some. My knowledge base was broadened by learning about the application of DSP to the world of MEMS. I previously knew a small application-model making MATLAB, now I know how an actual industrial sensor would be completely modeled in MATLAB. I workedwith a real product of the company that would be sold to customers at a later stage. This experience of working with a team on a product is something that would help me in my future.

It was a good industry experience. We worked in Memory Design Team in ARM Noida. It taught us about SRAM design. In college, we were taught how things happen in theory but seeing them in industry taught us about challenges faced in real implementations. It was a good exposure. The team we worked with was very supportive. We learnt about various types of SRAM’s, 6 transistors to 14 transistorsimplementations, SRAM architectures, timing analysis, clock generation techniques, SRAM assist circuits, read, write assists, POR circuits, ADM, WRM, SPICE, reliability of electronics, second order affects etc. We did a lot of literature survey. We read over 40 IEEE papers. Most of these things were new to us. It broadened our knowledge base. These are used all over industry and we hope they help us in our future endeavors. The 5 and half month experience taught us things we could not have possibly learnt in college. It also gave a flavor of corporate life. We were sponsored a free trip to ARM Bangalore to celebrate ARM’s 25 year anniversary.The assist circuit that we implemented was a new technique never used in industry before. Itallowed operation of 6 transistors SRAM at 0.3, 0.7 volt –something never done before. It will be very useful in future. ARM is heavily investing in IoT(Internet of Things)arena. IoT requires ultra-low power consumption because wearable electronics is required to last from days to months to years (like pacemakers in heart patients). Most energy consuming part of electronics is the SRAM memory. The energy consumed scales down with square of voltage. Earlier the supported voltage was 0.45, 0.7V. By allowing operation at 0.3, 0.7 V, it will be very useful in future. In last few weeks, we also worked on an idea for which patent was filed.

My project was on generating verilog timing test benches for multiple families of cells. This required a working knowledge of Verilog and a basic understanding of latches and flip flops. As the project progressed, I began to understand a number of different aspects of standard cell design and validation. It is importantto realize that as interns, we are expected to go with the workflow that is present in the team and this internship is not about path breaking research but smaller changes to optimize or improve this workflow. The first step is always to understand the system in place, understand what is being done and why it is being done. During this five and a half month long internship, I have had to learn a number of different things like Tcl, Shell, etc. Asking your manager/mentor is the best thing to do about any doubt or anything you want to learn. Internet is the next best thing. Spending more time on any problem that I faced, seemed to bring new solutions. Some of these solutions were acceptable, many were not. One of the tasks was to create a script for reading afile and making specific modifications. My solution was to read the whole file, make Modifications and rewrite the output file. This should work ideally, but the aspect I overlooked was that the file size can vary. Better solution is to read the file, line by line, make corresponding changes and write the output file, line by line. In academic work, ideal scenarios are assumed for tools, like the RAM will not crash but in industrial work; the worst case scenario has to be considered. A number of times, I have not understood why I was asked to do something by my manager/mentor, but later, the reason appears. Experience does matter. Two months are required just to familiarize with the settings, to do something concrete and meaningful, more time is required. The first test bench took around 1 month, the second took around two weeks and thethird took about 3 days. One important aspect of coding jobs is that the code should be developer independent. For this, it is necessary that proper comments are present. Career wise, this is a very good to point to have on a resume.

Fromthe entire experience, I have definitely gained a lot. I have learnt to lead a professional life and have understood how things work at an office. The PS experience has helped me gain knowledge about C coding hacks that help the processing time, the architecture of Broadcom’s processor, its advantages and drawbacks, on chip encoding and decoding procedures for Broadcom’s processor, debugging issues and a lot more. In terms of future career prospects, I have definitely gained a little edge as the projects Iworked on helped me get a grip over my basics which would help me in the long run. Major achievements would be that I successfully completed the DTS certification project assigned to me with the available resources and provide some sort of closure regarding most of the cases. I also optimized the codes using all the techniques learnt and caused a significant amount of reduction in the number of cycles and enhancing the frequency of the processor by almost upto 7 MHz put together for the Opus encoder.Domain -Electrical & Electronics EngineeringCompany: ARM Embedded Technologies Private Limited, BangaloreName of student: Kolisetty RamuduId:(2011B2AA678H)Discipline: I got the opportunity to pursue my PS II at BROADCOM Communications Technologies Pvt. Ltd., Bangalore which opened a door to an incredibly enriching experience for me. I worked in Audio Team of Broadband and Communication Group (BCG) under the supervision ofANIRUDDHA SANE, Sr. Manager-IC Design Engineering. I worked on Verification of DigitalSignal Processing (DSP) Subsystem at Chip and Core Level Environment in Audio Block of the Set-Top Boxes and Chip Level Script Creation using Broadcom Verification Library (BVL). I gained knowledge about Test bench writing and Test Environment of Chip Design under Test (DUT) and Verification Methodology. I have understood the Simulation Environment which plays an important role in Front-End Verification of SoC.Verification and Improvements in current run script for DSP Subsystem and various test scenarios have been included in the script. Uniform run script had been created for verifying the all the SoC. Based on the current and future SoC requirement, the script has been formulated in such a way one can easily launch the simulations. Apart from the project, Organization provided me to learn about the Perl Scripting and Audio-Video Compression Techniques.I feel like some learning modules which are specific to organization has to be given to students prior to joining the organization because out of 51/2 months nearly 1 to 2 months of time is spent on the learning basic things required apart from project related concepts. Through this program, I had hands-on experience to work on latest architectures while interacting with industrial experts. Academics thought me the basic concepts and the practical applications and scope of it, I understood through industrial experience. PS II experience helped me to know how industrial exposure will be a good advantage whenever I go for my higher studies.Besides the professional work, I had lots of fun too.

I am working in the V3D and M2MC Core verification team here. V3D is a 3D graphic processor core which is used in various Broadcom chips for set top box systems or multimedia systems. This team comes under the broad group called Broadband and Connectivity Group of Broadcom. Thus working here has been a goodexperience overall with the opportunity to learn real industrial projects. I have gained the basic knowledge about set top box, video and audio encoding and decoding techniques and the general flow of any project here. Since I am working in the verification team I initially got a project related to power analysis of the V3D core. I learned Perl scripting hereand wrote a script to get the power values and store into a database from which it can easily be accessed for analysis. The second project I did was to decode a .gd file again using Perl Scripting with the help of architecture specification of the V3D core. During this project I got to learn a lot about the architecture and about the operations inside a quad core processor. I also got to learn about the graphic processor’s parallel computing concepts. Thus these two projects related to V3D core helped me to get a good idea about thecore architecture, functions and power consumption. Apart from the projects themselves, the environment of verification taught me the methodology of verification, simulation and regressions, testing etc. By working here I learned that the level of complexity and abstractness is very high in the real world working designs and modules. Getting to know the entire flow of the product from design to the actual tapeout of the chip from the industry is definitely a different and more efficient way of learning than learning from the textbooks. These 5 ½ months experience in a core company has helped me to decide my career path, has opened up the different paths which I can take from hereafter depending on my interests. I now know the different departments and teamshere and the actual work they do. I now know what skills I would require to work in this industry and have already started to learn them here.

I have also learnt how to work in team and extract every bit of knowledge from my seniors and mentor as they were true guide for my progress in this project. I myself feel change in my personality after this precious PS-2 period. In the early stage it was slightly difficult or I can say a very new environment for me. Of course there were hurdles and problems in the beginning but my senior and other project fallows guided me well. Here, I have learnt various concepts of underwater communication and its transmission using electromagnetic wavesand acoustic waves. The task was to make a real time GUI which will give optimized carrier frequency at different depth and range so that data can be transferred with maximum data-rate and minimum power consumption. This PS was really helpful as I am looking for higher studies and a practice school in a best research institute of India will definitely going to help. One major achievement which I want to talk about is that I have simulated and implemented full channel characterization for electromagnetic carrier and acoustic carrier as well. But EM is very recent and hot topic in this field. So it gives great platform and introduced me to a recent trend in this field. In future I am also planning to write a journal level paper as I have conducted a deep analysis of channel condition.

Internship at Infinera will provide a great resource for that. Iowned the pleasure of working as Verification Engineer, in ASIC team Infinera as an intern during my senior year at BITS Pilani, Goa.My journey of gaining valuable experience was directed by my mentor, Mr. Paritosh Joshi, Senior Manager ASIC Design Engineering. From beginning to end, he was instrumental in guiding me whatever I needed to know and ultimately preparing me for my first job. The beauty of Infinera is you got to work closely with senior level positions and hence even your basic work gets appreciated.The teams are small, hence your work gets recognition easily. I worked on “Verification andValidation Infrastructure Enhancement for Mapper Chip”. I studied Verification Flow, tried toget familiar with Coverage’s, designed a tool to automate Interface Spec of ASICs/ FPGAs and finally converged upon Device Drivers and Sequences. I got enough chances to apply my technical skills in real life scenario. It was a memorable experience which will be cherished forever. One such achievement worth mentioning is when my tool development was accomplished and it worked perfectly, and uploaded to deploy in Infinera. This will be used continuously in future also to aid the verification process.These five months in Infinera provided lot of opportunities to hone the skills and develop interests while here. Out of many things I learnt, big and small, I would like to share one beautiful experience. Switching from academic to corporate, can sometimes get you in a little awkward situations. The difference between a Professor in College and your Mentor in Company is what took little time for me to understand. Calling mentor not by his name but‘Sir’ can offend him sometimes and create embarrassment for you. Referring him with his name along with a polite salutation is a stepping stone for good relations with him in long run. These small things teach Great lessons in life and createsweet memories.There are many lessons which I learnt from here. The one worth mentioning is team-work. Working for a company towards a same target itself means the same. This includes sharing the work of your co-worker during his break or coming out with a great thought together to meet the deadlines. Infinera treats employees and interns equally in all respects and hence it boosts the confidence of an internee. Infinera is epitome of people’s skills and has the potential to make good things tick.

Ltd., Bangalore","name":"Abhishek Madan","id":"2012A8PS389H","feedback":"PS2 was a great experience, got to learn a lot about functioning of the Intel. My work was in Formal Verification team at Intel. Microprocessor designs continue to increase in complexity. This can mean better performance, but the challenge of validating the design increases exponentially. The effort and time requirements of dynamic simulation are greatly increased. As the complexity increases the number of bugs also increases. The major challenge confronted by the semiconductor industry for the last few years is the problem of designing System-On-Chips with far more complex functionality and domain diversity than in the yesteryears, in significantly lesser time. The biggest problem is that of verification. Close to 70 percent of the resources are dedicated to the purpose of verification.Simulation has been traditionally used to verify the correct operation of systems. They are heavily dependent on the use of test benches. Test benches contain a set of input vectors, expected results, environment constraints and other necessary data. The input vectors are applied to the design under test (DUT) and the result obtained from the DUT is compared with the expected set of results for correctness. Real world designs will have a far greater number of ports resulting in millions if not hundreds of thousands of vectors. Simulation times will be significantly high, and as a result will not satisfy the time-to-market, which is counterproductive.Formal Verification has emerged as amethod in ASIC design to reduce verification times, not by accelerating simulations but by eliminating them once the initial design has been functionally validated. FV is basically an act of proving or disproving the correctness of a system with respect to certain formal specifications. Formal Verification algorithmically and exhaustively explores all possible input values over time. Currently the FV effort is not to replace simulation based verification. Instead it is to augment pre-silicon validation by proving total correctness of high risk functionality. Design simulation would catch bugs, but FV is used to ensure that no corner cases are missed.FV is increasingly playing a central part of all functional verification. For the Pentium 4 processor, FPV was primarily responsible for verifying the correctness of the entire arithmetic logic. It was possible to ensure 100% design coverage in this case. It was found that no design errors were detected in areas of the chip that were formally verified. Further FPV is capable of chip-complex protocols that are beyond the scope of simulators.Formal Verification helps overcome the shortcomings of dynamic simulations. Formal verification is the act of proving or disproving the correctness of intended algorithms underlying a system with respect to a certain formal specification or property, usingmathematical reasoning.Traditionally the SoCs are verified by simulations (Dynamic Verification), but as the simulation works according to the inputs specified the complex scenarios are not covered. If this bug gets skipped to manufacturing it leads to redesigning of SoC which increases the Time to Marketand the cost. To encounter this problem Formaluses tools and technique which try to verify the SoC design by Synthesisinstead of simulation. For synthesis formal uses a third party provided DesignWare library. As this library is made for simulations, there are few constructs which are notsynthesizable. The aim of the project is to create a library free of un-synthesizable construct which is functionally equivalent to the Design Ware library already available."},{"domain":"Electrical & Electronics Engineering","company":"Intel India Technology Pvt.

S., asked me to develop 3 apps for the conference, the basic purpose of which would be to enable users to rate/rank teams of 3 different contests at Intel. Based on these ratings/rankings, the winning teams would be announced. There was a presentation contest, a poster contest and a demo contest. The presentation rating app required the user to rate a presentation out of 5, while the poster and demo rating app required the users to select their top 3 posters and demos respectively. The end result was the development of 3 windows store apps which were successfully deployed on various tablets and laptops during the conference for the users to rate/rank the 3 different contests. This project not only involved the development of these apps, but also the development of batch scripts and windows console application programs to perform tests like merging of files collected from the various devices and the removal of duplicate entries. Once the entire contest had been rated/ranked by users, the next step was to merge the files and eliminate duplicateentries by the means of these batch scripts and windows console application programs. These programsProduced a final score sheet by the help of which the winners of the 3 different contests was announced. Achievements during the course of this project:1)This was the first time everthat apps were being used to rate/rank the 3 different Contests atIntel India’s SWPC. The earlier process involved pen and paper.2)This was the first time everI was developing an app.This was an independent project where all the 3 apps, batch scripts and windows console application programs were solely developed by me. My mentor, Mr. Ganesh Kamathand my team members were always there throughout to resolve any problems I was facing and assisted me in testing these out.3)Constant interaction with the panel that was responsible for organizing the event this year.

I looked into the varied possible uses of Lab VIEW to implement some measurements like Adjacent Channel Power (ACP), ModAcc (Modulation Accuracy), etc. This broadened my academic knowledge to a much wider spectrum of industrial applications and their thorough and meticulous implementations. The small part of code that I was asked to implement would enable an accessory functionality in the bigger picture of entire measurement. All this helped me get inspired and quenched my curiosity regarding the industrial treatment to a given problem. I learned many OOPs concepts also in Lab VIEW language and their immense dynamic usage to create multiple functionalities in a system. The scope of development was huge and innovative approach to solve within the industrial constraints was the challenge. It prepared me better to compartmentalize thinking to build the bigger picture. The PS experience did help give me an outlook of the industrial expectations and situations.2. “Auto-Detection of DMRS parameters”: In this project Igot to know a much wider application of reference signal usages in channel estimations. I got to work closely on developing a robust algorithm to recover reference signal parameters from noise corrupted ones. The task seemed simple at first sight, but soon seemed to overwhelm the possibility of any solution. This project taught me an important value –perseverance, which is a very important value in the both academic and industrial perspective. In spite of multiple failures from many different approaches to the same problem, I got to exercise many mathematical ideas which actually increased myexposure and outlook towards a problem with respect to timing, resources andsuccess rate. This project taught me more with each failure.

I got an awesome project, a wonderful mentor and an excellent platform to develop professionalism. The project that was allotted to me was ‘FPGA Accelerators.’ The main idea behind this project is to implement different communication blocks on FPGA.The challenging thing here is that very few people in NI Bangalore (Hardly 10 people) including my mentor had previously worked on Hardware Implementation on FPGA using Lab VIEW. Most of the Hardware development happens at NI Austin. So basically I have to learn to code on Lab VIEW FPGA all by myself with very little help from others.In the beginning I used to get struck on little things because of lack of informationon how to use the software. I felt that if only I had someone in NI who knows the software and can help me then I could get the little things solved easily and move on to solving bigger problems. I was impatient. After a few weeksI was slowly making progress but I couldn’t work to my fullest with that nagging feeling in the back of my mind. I used to get dispirited. I used to feel that I am not able to use my full potential on these silly problems. Then came my Mentor Gaurav Goyal to the rescue. Though it’s true that he had never previously worked in Lab VIEW FPGA, he has an amazing insight into how things work. The project itself was his brainchild. He taught me things both technical and non-technical. He taught me to do things in a step-by step process.He made me realize the virtue of Patience.

As part of another task I have worked on modifying the server to support UDP based media streaming. This task helped me become familiar with basics of networking technologies and socket programming. It also introduced me to various network layers and their respective protocols.Apart from learning various software related concepts, I havealso realized how working in industry is different from academic projects. In industry there is a lot of emphasis on correcting the corner cases associated with a given program. Also, the programs are subjected to large number of stress tests so as to make them as bug-proof and future-proof as possible. The programs are also reviewed by various people to reduce possibility of bugs. Moreover, even while writing a program, a lot of emphasis is laid on making it easy to read, understand and manage. These kinds of programming practices are very typical to industry.Practice School experience has also helped us become familiar with the required professional attitude and the working environment of companies. We also got an opportunity to interact with and learn from many professionals who already have a lot of experience of working in industry. The constructive feedback from them has helped us in developing new skills as well as refining other skills. Hence Practice school has provided us ample opportunity to implement the techniques learnt in classroom as well as learn new concepts. I sincerely believe that due to this hands-on experience we are now better prepared for the future and experienced gained here will help in smoother transition from academic to professional life."},{"domain":"Electrical & Electronics Engineering","company":"Nvidia Graphics, Bangalore","name":"Indira Venkataraman","id":"2012A3PS157P","feedback":"My internship at NVIDIA was from the 6th of July to the 12th of December.

One major point that I noticed during my PS2 is that in the industry/professional world,you don’t have to be good at a lot of things. If you know your subject properly, or have a skill that people can depend on, that is more than sufficient. Having technical acumen is not enough, the communication skills are as necessary to engineers as their technical expertise. When I mean communication skills, I mean the ability to accurately understand what the customer requires and converting that into technology. From a technical perspective also I have improved a lot during the course of this internship.It has helped immensely. Now I think I have a general idea of how things work and will be much more equipped to step into this world. I have also learned how to interact with people on a professional level.This internship has created an interest regarding Embedded Systems which lay dormant in me for some time. I would like to explore this field more and learn regarding the same. Even though I have implemented and delivered a product to Nvidia’s customers, I have released that I do have few shortcomings and this will require me to hone my skills.I have broadened my knowledge base in C programming, Shell Scripting, Operating System, Version Control System like GIT and Embedded Systems.

It really enhanced my classroom learning by gaining real world experience.I worked for CPU Formal Verification team. The Formal Verification is the methodology where we test the RTL design using formal methods of mathematics. We check the design for all set of inputs as such we find the bugs easily.Initially, I started with learning Linux commands, perforce commands and then understanding the flow how we compile the design and run the tool and debug the issues.I worked on the Second Level Clock Gating (SLCG) set-ups where we verify comprehensive clock gating by employing Sequential Equivalence Checking (SEC). While logic is being introduced to help with power optimization the basic functionality of the product should remain unchanged. It becomes important that we check the sanity of all thefeatures and hence verify all the aspects of the design with / without the power optimization enablement. I compared two tools VC-SEQ and JG-SEC, used to verify SLCG and gave my feedback on both of them and suggested ways to improve the tools.Apart fromthis I worked on system coherency block where we maintain coherency between the different levels of caches and memory.Internship here helped me in gaining knowledge of System Verilog, System Verilog assertions and good overview of CPU architecture and also Perl scripting.Transition from academic to industry was huge.

Be it academic wise or in regard to the industry exposure and experience in the same.During my project work, I came to know about various marketing techniques and how to conduct various types of consumer and customer surveys. After conducting those surveys results were collected and analysed to generate a problem statement that would address the customer needs. Now corresponding to those needs and problem statement possible solution ideas were generated. In college we are given theoretical knowledge as to how basic machines and mechanisms work. Practice School on the other hand provided a first-hand experience of how we have to integrate knowledge gained in college with hands on experience to generate an overall successful individual. Apart from the learning in the marketing department, there was inter-departmental work also. As my background is mechanical engineering I had very little knowledge about sensors and their working in systems. However in the company we came to know there is a very close relationship between mechanical and the electronics department. One cannot function without the other. Hence I had to learn the working of sensors too, in particular turbidity sensor because it played a major role in the prototype that we were developing as a part of my project. In a similar way, a study on weight sensors was also done which were to be integrated in the system. One major thing we learnt from the practice school was the value of teamwork and how biased our opinions can be sometimes towards something that we have developed despite that fact that it might be having a lot of drawbacks. To solve this problem of biasing, we conducted brainstorming sessions with other people in research and development division who provided us ideas and improvements that can be done in the solution that we were working on. After including the inputs from other people in the solution making process, the old model was improved and a new solution was developed. Aside from developing a working model, during the course of project we were also taught how to do solid modelling of any prototype for rapid prototypingin a variety of softwares and simulate the results.Overall the PS 2 helped a lot in getting good industrial exposure and developing a profile which will definitely help in securing a job in core mechanical sectors with the knowledge that we obtained from the experience."},{"domain":"Mechanical Engineering","company":"IFB Industries, Goa","name":"J M Madhoolika","id":"2011B2A4590H","feedback":"PS2 is one of the best platforms offered by BITS for better understanding of concepts learnt in classroom and also understanding the industry.

It was a very diverse learning experience right from the beginning. With Production Plant housed in the same place,we’ve got to learn the different mechanical systems that go into the making of a washingmachine right from Injection Moulding to Paint shop to the main assembly line. We also learnt of the different Quality testing procedures and the kinds of testing and benchmarking methods that any company follows. It was a phenomenal experience to watch how much organised work in the form of human and machine labour, systematic thought goes into the making of an appliance that ends up making our life so easy. More than anything it was beginning to appreciate and realise the nature and duty of engineers. I realised the method that goes into the making of any product that is from the product conceptualising stage to benchmarking stage and then coming up with a feasible idea and then turning it into a lucrative idea so that at the end of the day your brainchild becomes something tangible. From academic side too I’ve learnt a diverse range of topics like Microcontrollers, Power electronics, Analog Electronics andElectrical Motors. Though these were mainly the areas of study I’ve worked on I learnt not to restrict myself to a particular field and also learnt about Sensors and their Interfacing, PCB layout and schematic design and Embedded System programming. Working to realise a project that has been entrusted to me has challenged to erase my boundaries and involve in any sort of activity that ensures its fruitful completion. This is the major takeaway I’d say working in an industry does to a student just out from academics because a sense of responsibility and trust makes us matured enough to make a few compromises so that the goal is achieved on time. In its nascent stage the project was just a integration of a sensor but benchmarking other dryers by rigorously conducting a whole range of tests through Power analysers, Humidity sensor and Temperature Sensor, we were able to convince the company executives to go ahead with an upgraded automatic Dryer which would be in market next year. To realise that goal I had to begin with drawing a circuit for the main Power board, Interface board then prepare a hand soldered PCB for both the boards. Then I had to draw the electrical wiring diagram, prepare a hardware design required document (DRD) and software DRD. For software DRD I had to work with experts to design a program rhythm flow for all the programs that are going to being to be introduced in the dryer and conduct individual component test and validate the whole circuit. Now I would have to complete software development for the dryer and show a proof of concept to the company executives by the end of my term here.

A number of projects were available ranging from nanotechnology, fuel cells, solar energy which would attract any student who aspires to pursue pure research. I was really tempted to choose CSIR-NAL due to my interest and background in fuel cells. With a generous stipend provided by BITS and praises from my seniors, I chose CSIR-NAL.I did not regret my choice. Overflowing with scientists from IISc, IITs and even BITS, CSIR-NAL was a melting pot ofintellectuals. I was allowed to choose my project (which was fuel cells) and started my literature study to get a grip on a topic which has so much scope and potential. My instructors were helpful and understanding regardless of their outstanding background which made me realize the reason for the success of this organization. Ample funding for projects was helpful in acquiring the necessary equipments and materials that were required for my work. But one minor setback which I often faced was the slowness of the organization albeit it was expected due to the size and complexity of it. It will take some time to adjust to the pace for someone coming from the very fast, flamboyant and flexible BITS culture.Apart from the slowness, the sheer perseverance exhibited by some of the scientists was a surprise to me. Patience is the only partner at times when you don’t get the results you expect.This is something which really affected my approach to pure research. Also the inclusiveness of all peers irrespective of their background in project discussions however small it may be was another rarity. At the same time, a chain of command does exist as much it does in any major institution and exposure to the same for first time was different experience which will yieldfruit in future endeavors. Research work in CSIR-NAL is an amalgamation of both openness and closeness, were projects students sometimes work on multiple projects or are asked to focus on only one.Overall, the experience in CSIR-NAL taught me to how to handle tight deadlines, manage resources, delivering at full capacity which is expected in any corporate environment."},{"domain":"Mechanical Engineering","company":"National Aerospace Laboratories, Bangalore","name":"Sharad Chauhan","id":"2012A1PS555G","feedback":"During these 5 and ½ months, I worked on the “Modeling of a solid oxide fuel cell” in the SED division.

It is a fast growing startup. It was the best opportunity to specialise in Machine Learning in industry. In hindsight, I am more than happy with the decision. The team at Belong entrusted me to redesign and build one of the fundamental product features. Belong introduced me to two helpful external mentors. One on engineering aspects, and other on Data Science aspects of the same.I designed, built, tested and deployed a machine learning model in production. One of the primary objectives when building this was to enable faster iterations. This capacity build should allow for incremental improvements.One of the key learning from this experience has been understanding the gap in both my software engineering and machine learning skills, even more so from an industry perspective. Luckily, I have a semester ahead to fill some of those gaps.A lot of learning has been experiential. This could include working in agile teams with daily scrums & sprint planning and the like. I have come to imbibe the importance and discipline of tracking the correct metrics. I am more appreciative of the importance of customer success and sales teams in a business.The experience of seeing the team grow from 30+ to 70+ people has been phenomenal. The learningcurve has alternated between acquiring knowledge and wisdom. These lessons will serve me for as long as I can remember them.

I also learnt how to write and deploy a stand-alone web server (written using Node.js) in Heroku and Open shift, since traditional web hosting sites do not generally support Node.js. I believe learning new technologies is beneficial for a person’s career, since he can then keep track of the various developments in the field of computers to build better applications. In fact, even some of my seniors working in the company pointed out that web development is a useful skill to add to one’s skill set since there’s a lot of demand in that area.

I belong to Mathematical background with a keen interest in programming. Not being a pure Computer Science student never came in my way to perform tasks and learn new things here. I was assigned to a team which has most of it’s work done in Android. Since I pursued ObjectOriented Programming at campus, learning Android became easy because of it. Besides android, I was also requiredto write some scripts to fetch different data. For this purpose, I learnt Python and was able to get the desired output. It was great to implement academic knowledge to fulfil the objectives I was supposed to do.Flipkart is a well established company now but the startup culture still prevails here. The working hours are very flexible. The most important thing here is that you complete your work under the stated deadlines which made me learn to complete tasks assigned to me under strict deadlines. I also learned how to work with a huge team because while you are workingtowards a feature in the app, someone else is also working towards something else in the same app so we had to co-ordinate with a lot of people so that multiple people don't affect each other’s changes. Here I got to meet a lot of smart people and they helped me learn more about this industry as well as help me with my projects.It was my first exposure to IT culture and this programme helped me in every possible way to make transition from an all academic environment to an industrial environment.

But it’s all a part of this world. This dynamic, fast paced, and in my opinion, amazing world.We hit the ground running in our first week at here. We were assigned projects and were expected to familiarize ourselves with the stack fairly quickly. There was no moment where we were considered less capable because we wereinterns. That gave us an immense boost and push to code and contribute. In my first two weeks I contributed 900 lines of code and was already intimately familiar with some parts of the repository.The most impactful thing I’ve learnt as an intern is the approach to solving problems. There has to be an attitude of immense relentlessness amongst interns. Most students who are trying to contribute code to many open source projects usually get dejected, because of a roadblock in their first few days. One mustremember that many people have faced the same road blocks, and Googling and seeking help is completely accepted, and in fact, encouraged.The industrial internship is one of the finest places to see the “hacks” that people implement in crunch times. It’sgreat to realize what actually matters and what doesn’t. You come to realize that memory complexity isn’t as important as it is in college. Time is important. One of the other major things one learns is how to install things and setting up an environment.That is usually the first roadblock when people start to code. And more often than not, it’s pretty easy to go wrong. One needs to be persistent.All said and done, my time at Housing was a wonderful experience.

I was looking forward on working with Housing, the next big step in my life.The past 6 months have been awesome to say the least. The initial week was basically getting to know about the company, how its divided into clusters, the work culture etc. The best part was getting to choose your own team. I wanted to work with the Android team and I was assigned theSolutions’ cluster Android head, Ravikiran Sahajan as my mentor. A lot depends on how the mentor assigned to you is. Ravikiran saw us, me and the freshers that had joined along with us, as an investment. He was a constant help throughout the internship program. I was given the app’s source code and I along with the other freshers, Vinil and Rohit, in the Android team began understanding it, package by package. Ravi was always there to help us understand code we did not understand. Just by reading code one gets to learn so much. Various code practices used in organizations, smarter ways of doing the obvious steps, managing space and time complexity.The first code snippet written by me was pushed into Housing’s main Android app somewhere inAugust. It is a special feeling when your code goes into production and such a platform is given by both PS-II and Housing.com policies.I learned a lot during my stay here.

The PS-2 program is well structured, extensible, and intensive with a lot of learning opportunities.The project that I was a part of was very exciting, providing me an opportunity to learn and apply cutting edge software technologies in various projects. My Manager, my mentor and other teammembers were very open, friendly and helped me realize my potential. My role in this team as software developer was to develop a mobile app for GetThere using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular JS, Cordova, MySQL, PHP etc. which involved the following: 1) Integrating the existing mobile UI of GetThere in the app 2) Creating an auto-login feature after one login 3) Adding newfeatures to the app like managing and storing trip specific expenses and contacts for corporate travellers.This internship at Sabre also emphasized on being a complete professional who has both technical and business acumen. A competition “Global Hackathon” was organized for all the employees and interns to showcase and implement their hack ideas and present it in a 3 minute long video. I was overjoyed to work along with my fellow interns and my mentor on a challenging hack idea. This Global Hackathon project was the highlight of my internship with great mentoring support,interviewing and sharing ideas with top executives of the travel industry. We secured the 2ndposition in Global Hackathon under the ‘Payments’ category which is a proud moment for me and my teammates. I was amazed to experience the close knit culture that Sabre embraces, where an intern like me was able to meet top executives and openly share ideas.Sabre is a great place to work with amazing work-life balance and is constantly striving to be the number one in travel industry through various initiatives. I also had great time at Team lunch outings and various team building activities.

One major formof assistance that we got from our team was in terms oftraining sessions in the first month for the major technologies used by them –Java, MySQL, Flex, Apache Tomcat and JDBC Drivers. Being completely new to the domain of Web Development, this with some small assignments really piqued our interest. Self-study was encouraged by our team-mates and doubts were effectively and promptly clarified for our projects further. I havelearnt a lot of technologies in a few months and built a certain level of proficiency in them. This definitely bolsters my technical skills which were at a very basic level as I was academically an Electronics student.My project work was to solve the performance issues of a web application used by the QA teams at Sabre and add further useful features to enhance its functionality. I had to learn 7-8 technologies for this web development task. I had to also understand various other tools used by the QA teams which are used as sources of data for this web application. My peers got work ranging from building Android apps to Junit testing, so there was a plethora of work to choose from and learn.Our office has a great work culture and organized a lot of events this past semester of which we got to be an important part. Ranging from fun events like the Sabre Annual Day to innovation-focused events like the Global Hackathon, we got exposure to a lot of activities here and learnt immensely from them. Our mentor, Mrs. Preeti NG, was supportive of all our activities and motivated us for participation in addition to making sure that our project work would never suffer. She also helped us in developing soft skills by giving us some team-building and organizing work in addition to smoothly conducting all evaluation components.

The results of the past shape the decisions of the future. But there are some things which require spontaneity or rather it’s the only option. It’s good, it’s exciting but it can’t always ensure success. Sitting for campus placements or getting out of the college and searching for jobs often ends up being sudden and unplanned for most of us. Keeping that in mind, BITS has designed the Practice School Program.Practice schools allow students to have a trial run at industry life while still being a part of the college. This is something exclusively offered to its students by BITS Pilani. Not only do these Practice Schools offer a rare opportunity to experience industry life before actually being a part of it ,but also to learn newer and exciting technologies while working in the industry. They offer work experience to shape future career decisions.Personally this has helped me further my skills to a newer level. I have had many opportunities tolearn and work with technologies, which I haven’t used before. This has been tremendously helpful, as I come from a non IT background but with a love for IT. Being a part of SABRE, India under the guidance of Mrs. Preeti NG has been one rare opportunity where not only have I developed mytechnical skills, but also my non-tech skills, which I learned from my industry experience, are equally important.This experience has allowed me to broaden my career prospects as well. I believe the skills developed here will definitely allow me to think far and beyond the conventional job opportunities. Other than the expansion of knowledge PS offers something very important and unique, which I believe is of importance above all, Soft Skills.Today industry needs people who are not just good at their work, but also have excellentCommunication Skills, Team Work, Adaptability as well as Conflict Resolution. These skills can’t be found in any books, these can only be learned through practical experiences. Being part of a team, solving problems together, managing things under pressure and then presenting the results in front of all the leaders with high expectations from you is something that college life can’t offer. ThePractice school program solves this problem very efficiently.It’s also very important to understand that PS is not some sort of isolated experience, where you are cut off from your college. On the contrary it’s a rare amalgamation of both which is very diligently ensured by the PS instructors. It is ensured that the learning at the industry is relevant as well as beneficial to the student.PS can be effectively summarized as a crash course to industry life, where you not only learn technical skills but more importantly life-skills. You develop a new viewpoint like never before, a viewpoint honed by practical experiences. These experiences are crucial to shaping one’s ideology and hence a personality, that is ready to be a part of something more, something bigger."},{"domain":"Computer Science","company":"SAP Labs, Bangalore","name":"Akhil Gudavalli","id":"2012A7PS028H","feedback":"This Internship is my first experience at an IT company.

It was a very good learning experience for me. The fact that I could contribute to an industry level product instilled a great sense of confidence in me. New technologies which I have learnt during the course of internship include Restful Web Services, JSON format of communication, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and dot-net application Development. The innovation projects brushed up my java skills which included front end development in html and JSP files and JDBC connection and communication with the backend SQL database. Whereas, in App-model development, Front -end is CSS, HTML and JavaScript coded which makes a call to restful APIs using JQuery ajax commands with json being the data format of communication. Basically, it gave me an overview of web application development to quite an extent. Apart from the development, I had to conduct an extensive research on the previous architecture of our product’s integration withSharePoint which helped me in learning c-sharp and debugging dot-net applications. In college academic, we learn each of the components of product development separately, during the internship we get to combine all those concept and try to shape them to the useful component of the product. Now, that we are able to create something substantial it boosts the confidence and prepares us for the upcoming interviews. As, a product enterprise is trying to adopt newer technologies always, I got to learn new technologies and got to implement them as well. These, and a lot more are the learning I am taking away from this internship. I hope my contribution was credible to them as well. The previous SharePoint integration has serious installation issues for the customers and debugging issues for the developers.

I got to know about the various tools and techniques used to make the work more convenient and collaborative development.My main work included solving customer related issues and writing scripts for automating various things. I worked with technologies like Java, .NET framework, C#, PowerShell and python. My work helped me enhance my coding skills as well as gaveme knowledge of various new technologies used frequently in the industry. It also taught me how to effectively log the useful information and error messages. This knowledge will be greatly helpful for me in my future endeavors. I also learnt how to integrate systems running in two different stacks and run them seamlessly.I learnt about tools like splunk, SVN, Crucible, Confluence, JIRA, etc. These tools are used in almost all the industries for effective and collaborative development. The knowledge of these tools will greatly help me in future projects as well. I also worked on writing a script for integrating these platforms and generating an integrated set of information to avoid the hassle of going to various places for various kinds of information. Italso helped in regulating the check-ins that are going in and alerts the right people if some check-in has gone in without any code review. This helped me to get familiar with the subversion, crucible and JIRA APIs. It also helped me get a better understanding of REST APIs and how to work with them. Also, I learnt a lot about writing scripts for automating tasks.Another major thing that I learnt from my PS-II experience was the importance of the code reviews. Proper code reviews are absolutely necessary before the code is checked in. These reviews should also need to happen from a number of people instead of a single person as it will help bring out the fault in the code for sure. Checking the code for errors is of utmost importance in any kind of software development scenario and it becomes even more important if multiple people are working on the same project and changes made by one person may affect the ones made by others.Apart from work I also had a lot of fun at my PS-II station and enjoyed my duration here.

And no matter how clueless you are on some topic or subjects, it is always good to shed the inhibitions and ask someone, it doesn’t matter how small the doubt is. Increase in tolerance and handling frustrating situations calmly are also the major takeaways from PS. On the materialistic perspective I learned how to handle Servers, make flash animations and work with complicated databases.There is a great difference between academics and industry work, though tools and ways are same, in college all we care about is working on ideal laws and deliver best solution possible, while in industry all that matters is “getting things done” until it works well for everybody and doesn’t break things. Before my PS, I never worked on such a large codebase where a small change needs hours of searching and alterations. This kind of experience is unimaginable in the college. This PS will definitely augment my future prospects as now I would be entering in the world with a firsthand experience.

Finance Change basically provides high-quality, cost-effective services to support various Credit Suisse business divisions. During my brief stint with Credit Suisse I was able to understand the process how the change management works. We (Project P7 team) works with Product Control division of credit Suisse providing them with better solutions and optimizing Process they use to perform their daily tasks thereby saving man-hours and cost for Company. As Product Control division works on finalization and providing Signoff for each trade that happen in CS across Globe , It became necessary to understand how a transaction/trade is performed i.e. starting from Front Office where trade is booked to Its final posting in general ledger. Because of this, past Four month have been very helpful and resourceful to me to grow professionally as well as increasing my knowledge about various instruments used in financial sector. This internship has helped me to decide in which field I would like to direct my career in financial sector. I have also got a brief insight on complexness of financial sector, and how each decision taken is driven by strategic requirement needed. I would like to add that knowledge gained from direct industrial exposure is more brief and vast then we learn from class room knowledge.

I work in Backtesting team which is crucial for the Regulatory Capital Management of the CS group. The entire process was full of learningfor me. It involved VaR calculation using scenarios and P&L strips in historical simulation method. It is performed on T+2 basis using VaR for T-1. Then comes comparison of VaR and P&L for each business level of the CS group. In case an exception arises, it is to be investigated as to why the exception arose. Through this procedure I got a flavor of the industry and understood how every market move impacted different business lines of the company. I could actually analyse the trades more closely and arrive at a conclusion explaining the correlation between the market fluctuations and the exception that arose.In all these months I have learned a lot and at the same time also realized the places where I lack knowledge and need to brush up.This will help me become more competent in my future endeavors. I can work on those areas in the next 6 months period I have in college.I feel the very purpose of PS2 is fulfilled as I got to work as a part of a team where synergies make a big thing come true. I learnt to perform in pressure conditions with accuracy.I got clear about my future prospects and learned the fact that this is where a person starts and eventually grow. When you work as a part of a big firm and you share responsibilities, you need to be confident for every step you take as at the end you are answerable for any outcomes. So it was a good experience here in Credit Suisse , lot of things learnt , a sudden change of mindset and I am sure eventually these things will be reflected in my daily actions too."},{"domain":"Economics Finance","company":"Credit Suisse, Pune","name":"Sankalp Kothari","id":"2012C6PS845H","feedback":"I am a Credit Risk Analyst in Derivative Products at Credit Suisse, Pune.

It helped me realise where I want to direct my career \"and where not to\". I will say that this part of 4-year should not be of Theoretical learning rather Industrial experience, meeting people and learn about their actual experience (which is very different from what we see in videos and seminars). I can surely say that Interns have out-performed most of the full-time colleagues and exceeded expectation of their managers and Credit Suisse by a large difference."},{"domain":"Economics Finance","company":"Credit Suisse, Pune","name":"Shruthi Pandey","id":"2012A2PS049P","feedback":"The Practice School Program was a major transition from theoretical based learning in College to a real world implementation in the industry. Since it was finance based and I worked in the risk management team.I have learnt key aspects of risks existing in various investments, the importance of keeping a check on those risks and the entire infrastructure that is involved in this elaborate process. Credit Suisse as part of its risk management deals with majorly three types of risks-Market Risk, Credit Risk and Operational Risk. As part of Market risk Scenarios team, I got to learn about various factors that decide the profits/losses made in the portfolios example the movements in Interest rates, Forex and Commodities. An important feature of keeping a cap on these risks is to be able to foresee the major market moves which necessitates generation of Scenarios on our portfolios or also called the What If analysis. In this analysis, the idea is to bump various parameters like the Spot price, the Volatility or the Correlation and then see the impact of these bumps on our portfolio. Finally the drivers of our losses are figured out and according to the risk limits that we allot, information is conveyed to the traders. The significance of risk management has risen following various financial crisis events involving collapse of major financial entities and hence being a part of a team like this helped me develop an understanding of the crucial processes that are driving the trades being placed in the front office.The duration of the internship was optimal in the sense that it gave me time to both learn the basics that I was going to use in the months to come and also implement those leanings in a gradual manner. In the initial few months, my focus was on learning as much as I could about our team, the workflow, the basics of risks and risks managements across asset classes. This also included honing my Excel skills and learning concepts in VBA which would be useful in accomplishing the daily deliverables in my team. After the initial phase of learning, I was involved in the team work and took up some existing reports and was given the chance of starting new reports as well. This initial phase of helped me a lot in the process and enabled me to smoothly transition to an industry environment.Industrial experience is a good way of broadening your knowledge base and at the same time enables you to practically understand the end to end process from placement of trades to managing risks in these trades and making profits. It is a platform to be able to take up key tasks and also be responsible for the timely delivery of schedule based deliverables. The experience helps one to discipline oneself in terms of deadlines and accuracy and also allows the space to implement any new changes that can make the processes more efficient and innovative.Credit Suissehas provided an excellent platform for learning in the form of various Study modules, guest lecture sessions and also weekly meetings to discuss concepts within teams. In the initial months, many of the modules that were rolled out to us were mandatory. Apart from that, whatever free time was available between day to day work could be utilized for goingthrough many more of these modules. They cover a huge scope of topics from basics of financial markets to studying Exotic options and complex Option strategies. I have learnt a lot of concepts through these packages not just pertaining to our team but across the entire industry. The guest lecture series was also an enlightening experience with people holding years of experience giving their valuable time in guiding the interns. Also, in my team the weekly meetings entail very useful sessions for discussion of Market moves and a broad arena of concepts.Credit Suisse is one of the best places to start with for an undergraduate. This is because it helps you attain a gradual learning experience. As a part of the team, you meet people with varying years of experience who cooperate with you in not just learning the team work but also share their insights into the work and the career prospects one has during and after some work experience. I would like to start my career in a place like this, learn for few years and then make good utilization of my work experience in a firm like this to opt for higher studies. Having done an internship here also broadens my chances in applying for a firm that aligns well with my requirements and expectations.As I mentioned previously, the internship process gives you the freedom of coming up with new suggestions for the team and also participate actively in team activities. I have taken up initiatives in my team to accept new tasks as part of the daily work and have participated in the Weekly sessions. I organized two presentations during the course of the internship using Excel and VBA models. My way of approaching the concepts was well appreciated by the team and it also helped me bring forth my ideas in front of others and hence open up confidently to everyone around."},{"domain":"Economics Finance","company":"DBOI (Deutsche Bank), Mumbai","name":"Ghantasala Sai KrishnaId","id":"011B3A4604H","feedback":"Deutsche Bank is a German global banking and financial services company with large presence in Europe, Americas, Asia Pacific and Emerging Markets.

The organization is open to offering pre-placement offers, conditionally. For the first time, in January, Product Control –Emerging Markets is also hiring BITS interns.My experience in Market Risk has been thoroughly engaging yet demanding. The highly professional setup provides a huge learning opportunity. I was assigned to Market Risk Change (MRC), a team which works on the various strategic infrastructure of the bank. With the growingcomplexity of the banking structure along with increased regulatory requirements, banks need to continuously improve their risk framework. MRC works on applications which are more efficient and also comply with regulatory requirements such as BASEL III and FRTB.In the initial weeks, I spent my time learning tools such as Excel VBA, SQL, and MS Access. Although I have used Excel in college, it is only after coming here that I realized its potential.Handling large and complex data is a part of market risk’s work and it is imperative to be proficient with Excel. The job requires knowledge in derivatives, Greeks and several concepts of risk management. The course Derivatives and Risk Management has helped me understand much of the work the department undertakes.In summary, I found the internship to be fast-paced and stimulating.

All dressed up in formals made us feel responsibility holders and gave us a feeling that from now on life is about to change from the old college life. But irony played its role as we were the only ones dressed in formals and all other employees were dressed in smart casuals and were staring at us as if we were the odd ones. Then we were allotted to our teams and our managers told us about the organization and the type of work that is done in the team. We were also told that now-a-days not much focus is given on the formal dressing way but smart casuals are more preferred. I still remember the first thing my manager told me on the first day which is-“Life in an office is all about your capabilities and the way you tackle your problems. No one is going to see what you are wearing or how many hours you are working, all that they see is whether the work is done or not.” Listening to this gave me a little motivation and at the same time my heart was also gripped by the thought that this is the place where I am going to learn a lot.Soon the work began and we were allowed to attend various client calls and watching our mentors talk to the clients helped us in understanding how exactly to deal with the international businessmen. Soon I started talking to clients and I was allotted to a client in France with whom I was working on my R-Programming projects. He and I used to solve various problems together and working with him gave me a very detailed glimpse of the work culture in Europe. I started learning the basics of R programming after I joined the organization and son I got a little better at it and most of the R prog work in my team was done by me only. Work wise I got a chance to work in the field of my interest and I also got to apply some of the Mathematics concepts which I had done in college.Work was not the only aspect of our organization. We had lots of fun in office too. Every evening I used to play chess with some employees and sometimes carom or Table tennis also. The office hours were not strict and the work environment was also very friendly.Working in this organization has helped me understand that in order to excel in what we do, we not only need to have great skills but also a good personality and right decision making ability.

I came here to feel the life of an startup city, I was not able to resist the temptation of it and decided to go to Bangalore.It happens that I was assigned to a data analytics company. This time, I expected myself to go beyond my limits, to learn as much possible and be a major contributor in the work of my team. But things were pretty much different here from my imagination. Being a Data Analytics company, I had anticipated taking more from them than whatI would be able to give to them since my background is of mechanical engineer. I was tasked with analyzing data and putting it into right format, all done manually. I figured that out that there is a need in a change of ways the people were doing work in the team. Initially it felt to me that our team was called a team only for its sake and instead of work and interests it is only the team name which connects us. I learned a bit of coding and automated a manual task which turned out to be much effort saving. My mentor and team mates applauded me for that. Since most of my team-mates were not having any knowledge of coding, I explained to them it's working. Meanwhile I continued on my coding and started replacing part by part of our process with codes. Helping each other and mutual benefit of knowledge makes a team sustainable and everyone participates in decision making, where no one is leader and everyone is a leader in himself.These elements I wanted to create in our team. But I guess that the period turned out to be short for doing this. I did not have expected myself to learn coding but things usually go different from what we had planned. I do not know to what purpose in future this coding may come to my use but I know that a computer science course studied in my first year came to use in my internship for which it was not taught initially in the first place. Automating in analyzing data is need for every industry and this is what industries aspires for.An experience of corporate sector has taught me more about people than I can claim for about work. Since our work methods were not up to the mark, there was a room of improvement. And I myself felt lucky that it became a chance for me not only in a way to put value addition to our work but also to get the people learn useful things which could matter in their work.Apart from all of it, the codes I made amounted to save an estimate of $5000 of company in terms of saving its man-hour."},{"domain":"Economics Finance","company":"Goldman Sachs India Pvt.

Despite being from a civil background, I got a chance to lay my hands on something that had deeply interested me-Big Data Analytics. My learning curve started the moment I entered Godman Sachs from working across time zones to building a network of my own. And the technical knowledge I received from the project was icing on the cake. I learnt about data warehousing and analytical reporting tools which majorly impacted functions across the division reducing their reporting time from monthly to daily basis and drastically reducing manual labour, hence increasing the efficiency, which I believe is a major achievement for the firm.The Goldman experience helped me understand how the corporate world looks and works like. It helped me apply my technical knowledge to practical scenarios, transitioning from learning in college to application in the firm. The most important thing that I take back from this whole experience is grooving yourself around people and deadlines. I learnt to chart out the agenda and deliverables and then plan the timelines accordingly.I would take this opportunity to bring into the picture the vast amounts of technical knowledge I learnt in the form of tools that helped me expand my knowledge base in Big Data domain.

It didn’t take as long as I expected to blend into the corporate environment. I was given a project on automation and analysis, and my team had no prior experience in these fields as all of them are from a commerce background. The team was heavily banking upon me to thinkof automation and process improvements to make their work efficient and easier.I grabbed this opportunity, learnt Visual Basic to code macros in Excel and didn’t stop making macros until my last day at Goldman Sachs. I also performed analysis on historical data to arrive upon trends which greatly benefited the team. I also gained a significant amount of knowledge regarding the international market and trading world from my team.I have a lot to take back from the 5 months I spent here. This was my first internship where my work had an important role to play in the day to day performance of the team. I learnt how to manage my time and plan ahead to meet deadlines. Goldman Sachs has disciplined me in multiple ways, be it following a strict login time every day or how to conduct myself in front of Vice Presidents and Group Leaders. I have observed how my team covers for others when someone is on leave, which reinforces the importance of teamwork in the success of any organization.

The rest of the day involved introductions and first day procedures. We had multiple training sessions over the next fewweeks with the team which gave us insight into the work that they did. We learnt how to work with Excel, how to handle huge amounts of data and analyze it, licensing metrics of various publishers, how to do research on prospective clients and publishers etc. Work was assigned to us after that.The transition from college to work life was tough in the initial stages. There was a thorough re-vamp of our daily schedule from college. The new schedule demanded more advance planning and punctuality which was instark contrast to our schedule in college where time-tables were flexible and there was room for spontaneous planning. Both the life styles have their own set of pros and cons. As we went through the rigors of day-to-day work and faced new challenges, we realized the importance of being one step ahead of the herd, which was very similar to the set-up in college, albeit in a less competitive setting. Internalization is a trait that needs to honed, when in the corporate setup.While the transition from an academic setting to a professional one can be both considered a challenge as well as a learning experience, there are a number of skills a person can gain which goes beyond his or her technical knowledge base. These are commonly called “soft skills”. Soft skills are those skills which cannot be gained by merely reading a book or listening to a lecture, but continuous interaction with peers and seniors in the firm gives you a perfect platform to hone them. Example of such skills are interpersonal skills, language ability, social graces, leadership, interacting with clients and negotiating with an opposing party to reach a mutual consensus.
